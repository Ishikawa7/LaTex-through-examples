    \section{Introduction}
        This document will include some math.

        \subsection{Math Formulas}
            Mathematical equations cab be create inline as $5*4=20$, and can include a number of different math symbols, such as $7\leq 10$ is true.\\
            You can also put your equation on a separate line as \[5^2=25\] to call out the formula.

        \subsection{Float: Equation}
            My first result is shown in Equation~\ref{eq:minutes}, which shows the number of minutes in a day.
            \begin{equation}
                24*60 = 1440
                \label{eq:minutes}
            \end{equation}

            There are a lot of interesting math symbols, as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:symbols}
            \begin{equation}
                7^4+6*17\geq 13 \cup X \alpha 13 \exists \rightarrow nonsense
                \label{eq:symbols}
            \end{equation}

    \section{Conclusion}
            Brief Introduction to math in \LaTeX.
